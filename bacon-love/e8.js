//
// The Earthian Defence Force has been able to obtain a decoding-machine that can
// translate commands from the Zrrk command. This machine does however require
// both the scrambled message and a unique key that unscrambles it. The EDF has
// learned that the Zrrk command sends these messages on two separate streams but
// in a synchronized fashion.
//
// Your job will be to combine these two streams with the decoder function and
// produce a stream of invaluable intel for the EDF.
//
// The decoder function, passed as the third argument, will take as its single
// parameter a tuple on the form [message, key].

module.exports = (Bacon, messages, keys, decoderFunction) => {
  return messages.zip(keys, (m, k) => decoderFunction([m, k]));

//             .zip(keys)
//             .map(decoderFunction);
